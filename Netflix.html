<h2> Netflix </h2>
<p> Somewhere between - Laura Price appears to have everything -- a successful career as a new producer in San Francisco,
    a powerful yet sensitive husband who serves as the city's district attorney, and a big-hearted 8-year-old daughter who is
    always quick to make friends -- but she lives in terror as time moves her closer to the seemingly inevitable moment when an
    unknown killer murders her little girl. The knowledge of when, where and how her child will be taken haunts her as she tries
    desperately to keep the child safe, always seeming to fail in averting fate.</p>
<p> Greys anatomy - The medical drama series focuses on a group of young doctors at Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital,
       who began their careers at the facility as interns. One of the young doctors and the show's namesake, Meredith Grey,
     is the daughter of a famous surgeon. Grey struggles to maintain relationships with her colleagues, particularly the hospital's
     one-time chief of surgery, Richard Webber, due to a pre-existing relationship between them - Webber and Meredith's mother had a
     personal relationship when Meredith was young.</p>
<p> Jane The Virgin - The daughter of a teen mother, Jane Villanueva grew up determined not to repeat her mother's mistakes.
        At 23, her life is on track; Jane is studying to be a teacher and engaged to a handsome detective who supports her
        decision to remain a virgin until marriage. Then a routine clinic visit flips her life upside down. Inseminated by a
        specimen meant for a patient in the next room, now-pregnant Jane is in a situation made only more insane when she learns
        that the sperm donor is her boss, Rafael. As her meticulously planned life gets more like the telenovelas she loves, she
        faces a lot of complicated decisions about where to go from here.</p>
<p> The 100 - When nuclear Armageddon destroys civilization on Earth, the only survivors are those on the 12 international
        space station in orbit at the time. Three generations later, the 4,000 survivors living on a space ark of linked stations
        see their resources dwindle and face draconian measures established to ensure humanity's future. Desperately looking for
        a solution, the ark's leaders send 100 juvenile prisoners back to the planet to test its habitability. Having always
        lived in space, the exiles find the planet fascinating and terrifying, but with the fate of the human race in their hands,
        they must forge a path into the unknown.</p>
<p> Shameless - Oscar-nominated actor William H. Macy stars as Frank Gallagher, a single father of six who spends much of his
     free time drinking at bars. The Gallagher children -- led by eldest daughter Fiona (Emmy Rossum), who takes on much of the
     child-rearing responsibility due to her mother's absence -- manage to raise themselves in spite of Frank's lack of parenting
      and unusual parenting style when he does choose to act like a father. The drama is an adaptation of the BAFTA Award-winning
      British show of the same name.</p>
<p> Criminal Minds - An elite squad of FBI profilers analyzes the country's most-twisted criminal minds, anticipating the
    perpetrators' next moves before they can strike again. Each member of the "mind hunter" team brings his or her expertise to
     pinpoint predators' motivations and identify emotional triggers to stop them. The core group includes an official profiler
      who is highly skilled at getting into the minds of criminals, a quirky genius, the former media liaison who manages to
      adeptly balance family life and work, and a computer wizard.</p>
<p> Secret Obsession - When Jennifer wakes up with amnesia after a traumatic attack, her doting husband cares for her. But she
     soon realises that the danger is far from over.</p>
<p> The Last O.G - Spending 15 years in prison didn't transform Tray, but everything else sure seemed to change. After he was
    released on good behavior, he returns to his newly affluent Brooklyn neighborhood and is shocked to find out how much
    different the world is. For starters, he's a father to twin sons, born to his former girlfriend Shay. She is now married to
    a successful white man who is helping raise the teenagers, who grew up in private schools and can't relate to their dad's
    hardscrabble upbringing. Wishing he could connect with his kids but having neither the money to support them nor himself,
    Tray relies on some well-worn skills to make ends meet while treading unfamiliar territory. Oscar winner Jordan Peele is
    co-creator and co-executive produces the series along with star Tracy Morgan.</p>
<p> Supernatural - This haunting series follows the thrilling yet terrifying journeys of Sam and Dean Winchester, two brothers
      who face an increasingly sinister landscape as they hunt monsters. After losing their mother to a supernatural force, the
      brothers were raised by their father as soldiers who track mysterious and demonic creatures. Violent memories and
      relationship-threatening secrets add additional burdens on Sam and Dean as they investigate all things that go bump in the
       night. As old tricks and tools are rendered useless and friends betray them, the brothers must rely on each other as they
       encounter new enemies.</p>
<p> Jessica Jones - This Netflix original chronicles the life of one of the darker Marvel characters, the mysterious Jessica
      Jones. When a tragedy puts an end to her short-lived career as a superhero, Jessica settles in New York City and opens her
       own detective agency, called Alias Investigations, which seems to be called into cases involving people who have special
       abilities. Suffering from post-traumatic stress syndrome, Jessica wants to do good, but her primary interest isn't in saving
       the world, it's saving her apartment and getting through each day. Based on a graphic novel intended for adults, this is not
        a superhero story for the kids.</p>
